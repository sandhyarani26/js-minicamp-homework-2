# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for` :This for loop contains three parts .One starting point,stopping point and next step of the loop.These three are separated by semicolons.And for loop is represented as (start;stop;step) and after this loop, statements will be in curly braces.
	ex: for(int i=0;i<3;i++) here starting point is 'i' is 0 and stoping point is 3 and loop is repeated by one point increment. 

	* `&&`, `||`, `!`: '&&' it is logical 'AND' operator .It is used to combine two logical expressions into one.If both expressions are true ,then single expression will be true.If either of them is false,then the total expression will be false. 
	Ex:  if((i%3===0) && (i%5===0)).In this example i=15,then two expressions are true so,'AND' operator is used.
	'||': This is logical 'OR' operator and this will be used when either of the two expressions is true. If one is true and second expression is false then the comination of these two will be true.
	'!':This is logicl 'NOT' operator.It returns opposite value.If it is placed before a true expression or statement that will be false and vice-versa.

	* Arrays: An array stores multiple values of data into a single line.It can store strings,numbers,booleans and etc. and these strings,numbers,etc. are separated by commas between square brackets.We can even store array in an array called nested array.Ex:var data=['sandya',123,true];  .

	
	* Git  :  This is used to store the files and projects we are working on. It also have a great uses all team members can have the laterst version of the files.
	It is used for the version control.
	* GitHub : open source implementation of the git.

2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`


4. Make the tests pass!
